# Blazor + Playwright
We love Microsoft!

## Why?
Let's say you made a blazor project and it's time to add end to end tests with playwright, well this repo provides instructions for solving some of the common problems. This repo is not designed to be cloned and used, but rather just provides some code samples and documentation on problems you may encounter.

## Setting Up Tests
Setup [bUnit](https://bunit.dev/docs/getting-started/create-test-project.html?tabs=xunit) first, we can use this for unit testing
